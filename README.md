# RaspberryPI-Tools

I've decided to make my daily tools available for public use. These are almost all a part of my daily cron jobs. I've just begun my Raspberry Pi journey, so I'm sure I'll have more to add in the future!

## spot.py

Takes a backup of my Spotify music library and places it in a log folder in my Nextcloud directory. Uses "Spotipy", a great tool to use the Spotify APIs.

## dailyTasks.py

I keep a day-to-day "Tasks.txt" text file, which I use to manage my life. It's basically a to-do list. This simply takes it from Nextcloud and emails me at 9PM each night so I can review and plan for the next day.

## timecard.py

My Raspberry Pi email everybody on a list on Thursdays to remind us to enter our time for the week. Anybody can sign up on [my website](https://tyler.cloud/timecard), or through our organization's internal website.
