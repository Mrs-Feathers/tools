# Smaller Projects:

## SecureData

I keep a "SecureData" folder within Tools to store email addresses, ZIP Codes, etc.
You will see most tools, particularly .py files, use secureData.py to retrieve this information to keep sensitive information out of GitHub.

## spot.py

Takes a backup of my Spotify music library and places it in a log folder in my Nextcloud directory. Uses "Spotipy", a great tool to use the Spotify APIs.

## dailyTasks.py

I keep a day-to-day "Tasks.txt" text file, which I use to manage my life. It's basically a to-do list. This simply takes it from Dropbox and emails me at 9PM each night so I can review and plan for the next day.

## timecard.py

My Raspberry Pi email everybody on a list on Thursdays to remind us to enter our time for the week. Anybody can sign up on [my website](https://tyler.cloud/timecard), or through our organization's internal website.
