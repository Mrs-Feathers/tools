# About

- This repository hosts some tools for my own personal use to make my life easier, primarily used by my Raspberry Pi. By sharing it with the world, I hope it makes your life easier, as well.

- See each individual file for information about that tool; tools in subfolders have their own ReadMe files.

- I welcome any comments or tips for suggestions- please visit tyler.cloud and click "reach out" to submit feedback.
