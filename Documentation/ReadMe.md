# About

This folder is designed to be my own internal reference for most of my tools. Smaller scripts may have their own ReadMe, but anything I use routinely should have a text file here describing any common issues I run into and their solutions.

Because I will routinely update this, this folder will also as a public documentation area. I welcome any comments or tips for suggestions- please visit tyler.cloud and click "reach out" to submit feedback.

# Smaller Projects:

## SecureData

I keep a "SecureData" folder within Tools to store email addresses, ZIP Codes, etc.
You will see most tools, particularly .py files, use secureData.py to retrieve this information to keep sensitive information out of GitHub.

## spot.py

Takes a backup of my Spotify music library and places it in a log folder in my Nextcloud directory. Uses "Spotipy", a great tool to use the Spotify APIs.

## dailyTasks.py

I keep a day-to-day "Tasks.txt" text file, which I use to manage my life. It's basically a to-do list. This simply takes it from Nextcloud and emails me at 9PM each night so I can review and plan for the next day.

## timecard.py

My Raspberry Pi email everybody on a list on Thursdays to remind us to enter our time for the week. Anybody can sign up on [my website](https://tyler.cloud/timecard), or through our organization's internal website.
