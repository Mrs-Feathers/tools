# OVERVIEW

I have two displays: my primary 1440p display and an adjacent TV. My desktop is attached to both, and most of the time, I prefer the dual-monitor setup for things like watching TV and dragging windows across at home.

However, I often remotely connect to my desktop through other one-monitor desktops or my phone. In these situations, I prefer only having one monitor. 

Rather than go through the Windows display settings each time, I've made these scripts, then set the icons in this folder as their icon, then dragged them to the Windows 10 taskbar.

This means that I can switch between two displays and one display by just clicking the icons on the taskbar.
